Hi there! ☘️

I'm Riye, Computer Science student at University of Birmingham

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and their potential to transform industries. As I move forward, I aim to specialize in AI/ML and Full-Stack Development, leveraging technology to create innovative solutions.

Outside of my academic work, I have a keen interest in aspiring design, particularly product design, where creativity meets functionality. Passionate to learn and explore new ideas, I strive to build solutions that make a meaningful impact.

Let's connect!
